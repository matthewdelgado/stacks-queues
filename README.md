# stacks-queues

This project contains a simple C++ implementation of fundamental **stack** and **queue** data structures.

Stacks and queues are elementary linear data structures that organize elements with restricted access patterns:  
- A **stack** follows **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** semantics.  
- A **queue** follows **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** semantics. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The implementation in this repository illustrates these concepts in a minimal codebase suitable for learning or demonstration purposes.

## Overview

- **Stack**  
  A stack lets you **push** elements onto the top and **pop** elements off the top. It can be used for backtracking, undo mechanisms, expression evaluation, and more. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Queue**  
  A queue lets you **enqueue** elements at the rear and **dequeue** elements from the front. Queues are common in scheduling and buffering contexts. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
